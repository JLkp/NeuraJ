## Description
This is a work-in-progress library for different kinds of neural networks. The library currently contains Feed Forward Networks. It originates from a university project in which I built a Feed Forward Network for image recognition with a fellow student. My goal for this project is to build a library that contains different types of neural networks purely built with Java and to learn about all the different types of neural networks that exist.

The current focus is on learning about the different types of networks â€” that's why the implementations are not very efficient. However, this could become a part of the project in the future.
