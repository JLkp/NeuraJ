## Description
This is a work in progess library for different kinds of neural networks. The library currently contains Feed Forward Networks. The library originates from a university project in which I build a Feed Forward Network for image recognition with a fellow student.
My goal for this project is to build a library that contains different types of neural networks purly build with Java and learn about all the different types of neural networks that are out there.
